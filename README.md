For quite a while I've been wanting to do something more minimalistic with my site but wanted it to be at least halfway
original, so after a while of procrastination due to being caught up with school I got a streak of motivation in May 2023 and finally accomplished a start to this

I have some fun stuff in mind like terminal games and other JavaScript related functionality to showcase my skills this is just the start

So far the site has the following features
- ?autoExec=CMDHERE param originally for testing and hot reloading my changes fast but also found to be useful for linking page content

    
    For example to use this on the help command you can go to this URL:
    https://zadenm.dev?autoExec=quickview

- Clear support by via ctrl+l
- Autocomplete support via tab
- Autofocus on page
- commands available: help, about, skills, clear or clr, quickview, echo, and oldsite
